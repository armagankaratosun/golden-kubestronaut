# Certified GitOps Associate (CGOA) Certification Study Guide

> 📌 Last updated: May 17, 2025 – CGOA exam passed on May 17

<p align="center">
  <img src="./../../img/gitops_associate.svg" alt="CGOA" width="250"/>
</p>

Based on its format and scope, I think CGOA might be one of the easiest certifications to start for those already familiar with DevOps, CI/CD, Git workflows, and tools like Terraform, Ansible, ArgoCD, and Helm. Since it's a multiple-choice exam focused on principles rather than hands-on tasks, it seems more approachable compared to other certifications in the Golden Kubestronaut bundle.

🧠 **Key takeaway:** The exam leans heavily toward concepts, workflows, and best practices rather than tool-specific knowledge.

## Who This Is For

- You’re a beginner trying to grasp DevOps, IaC, and CI/CD fundamentals — with an eye toward eventually adopting GitOps practices.
- You're familiar with DevOps, IaC, or CI/CD and want to transition into GitOps.
- You're looking for a lightweight CNCF certification to start with.
- You're exploring bundle deals like Golden Kubestronaut or THRIVE and want to make the most of them.

## Details About the Exam

While tools like ArgoCD, Flux, and Helm may appear, the focus is on understanding their role in **GitOps workflows** rather than command-line syntax or installation steps.

- **Type:** Online, proctored, multiple-choice test

To pass, you will need a score above 75%.

### Pricing & Registration

- **Exam Only (Standard Price):** $250 USD  
- **Bundle Options:** May vary. CGOA is often included in larger training bundles.

In my case, I accessed the certification through the **Golden Kubestronaut** bundle, which includes multiple CNCF/Linux Foundation resources and certifications.

#### My Recommendation

Unless you're in a rush or have a very specific reason:

> 💡 **Don’t buy the CGOA exam standalone at full price.**

Instead:

- ✅ **Look for bundles** that include CGOA (e.g., Golden Kubestronaut, THRIVE, or seasonal promos)
- ✅ **Wait for discounts or coupon codes** (Cyber Monday, KubeCon, etc.)

This certification is one of the **easiest to start** for people familiar with DevOps, CI/CD, and Git workflows, so it's a great entry point—but **only makes financial sense as part of a larger deal**.

### 🧪 Exam Tutorial (Optional, Worth Considering)

There's a **Tutorial Test** available before your actual CGOA exam, which might help you get familiar with:

- The secure browser
- The remote proctoring test environment

You can take it **up to 3 times**, and it lasts about **30 minutes**.  The link expires **150 minutes before** your scheduled exam.

> I haven’t tried the tutorial myself yet, but it seems like a good idea to explore—especially to avoid surprises with the test interface.

If you have time the day before or a few days in advance, it might be worth checking out.

## Study Guide

Based on the official curriculum, the CGOA exam is divided into  chapters covering **terminology**, **principles**, **practices**, **patterns**, and **tooling**.

### GitOps Terminology (20%)

**Why GitOps?**  

There are several use cases where GitOps shines — the most obvious include automation, continuous delivery, security, and compliance.

See: *“GitOps Use Cases - What Can You Do with GitOps?”*

#### Continuous

"Continuous" is intended to match the industry standard term: reconciliation continues to happen, not that it must be instantaneous.



#### Declarative Description

#### Desired State

#### State Drift

#### State Reconciliation

#### GitOps Managed Software System

#### State Store

#### Feedback Loop

#### Rollback

### GitOps Principles (30%)

GitOps is a set of principles for operating and managing software systems. These principles are derived from modern software operations, but are also rooted in pre-existing and widely adopted best practices.

</p>

📚 *Source:* [How to Ace the (CGOA) Certified GitOps Associate Exam](https://cd.foundation/blog/2024/07/10/ace-cgoa-exam/)  

The desired state of a GitOps managed system must be:

#### Declarative:
A system managed by GitOps must have its desired state expressed declaratively.

#### Versioned and Immutable:
Desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability, versioning and retains a complete version history.

#### Pulled Automatically:
Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from the source.

#### Continuously Reconciled:
Software agents continuously observe actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state.

#### Configuration as Code (CaC)

#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### DevOps and DevSecOps

**DevOps (Development + Operations)** is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to enhance collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The primary goal is to automate and streamline the processes of software delivery and infrastructure changes, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and faster, more reliable releases.
